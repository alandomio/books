# Research Instructions: Chapter 5, Scene 5
## "Il Monopolio Silenzioso (Brasile & Niobio/Terre Rare)"

**Objective:** Investigate Brazil's critical role in the global supply chain for Niobium (a virtual monopoly) and its emerging role in Rare Earths (Serra Verde), highlighting the geopolitical tug-of-war between the West and China.

### 1. CBMM & Niobium (Araxá, Minas Gerais)
*   **The Monopoly:** Confirm CBMM's market share (approx. 80-90%). How does this single mine control the global high-strength steel market?
*   **Chinese Influence:** Investigate the Chinese consortium (CITIC, Baosteel, etc.) that bought a 15% stake in 2011. Do they have veto power? Do they get preferential supply?
*   **Strategic Value:** Why is Niobium critical? (Pipelines, jet engines, bridges, EV chassis).
*   **Atmosphere:** Describe the city of Araxá and the mine. Is it a company town?

### 2. Serra Verde (Goiás) - The Rare Earth Hope
*   **Uniqueness:** It's an "Ionic Clay" deposit, the only big one outside China/Myanmar. Why is this important? (Easier processing, rich in heavy rare earths like Dysprosium/Terbium for magnets).
*   **Status:** Did they start commercial production? (Check early 2024/2025 status).
*   **Offtakers:** Who is buying? General Motors? Siemens? Or is it going to China for processing?
*   **Ownership:** Who owns Serra Verde? (Denham Capital? Pallinghurst?).

### 3. Geopolitics (Lula's Balancing Act)
*   **The Stance:** How is the Lula administration managing the pressure? "Non-alignment" or leaning towards BRICS?
*   **US vs China:** Any recent deals or visits? (e.g., Macron's visit to Amazon, or Chinese investments in EV plants like BYD in Bahia).

### Output Format
*   Compile a "Dossier" with:
    *   **Trigger:** A specific event (e.g., a shipment, a board meeting, a diplomatic visit).
    *   **Setting:** Visual details of the mine or the boardroom.
    *   **Key Players:** CEO of CBMM, Governor of Minas Gerais, or a Chinese representative.
    *   **Conflict:** The West wants to secure the supply; China wants to maintain its grip or at least a foothold.
