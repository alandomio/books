# Research Instructions: Chapter 6, Scene 4
## "La Rimilitarizzazione (L'Economia di Guerra)"

**Objective:** Depict the conversion of the global economy into a war economy. Civilian factories are now producing drones and shells.

### 1. The "Arsenal of Autocracy" (China/Russia)
*   **Factory Conversion:** Find examples of civilian factories (e.g., bakeries in Russia making drones, car factories in China making military vehicles) converting to war production.
*   **Dual-Use:** The blurring line between civilian and military tech (DJI drones, Starlink, etc.).

### 2. The "Arsenal of Democracy 2.0" (West)
*   **Rheinmetall/Lockheed Martin:** The boom in production. New factories in Germany, Poland, Ukraine.
*   **Labor Shortage:** The struggle to find skilled workers for these new factories.

### 3. The Setting
*   **Location:** A factory floor. Maybe in **Nizhny Tagil** (Russia, Uralvagonzavod) or a new **Rheinmetall** plant in Germany or Hungary. Let's contrast a high-tech German plant with a gritty Russian one, or focus on a **Chinese EV factory** that is secretly producing autonomous military vehicles. Let's go with a **converted automotive factory in Chongqing, China**.

### 4. Key Characters
*   **The Factory Manager:** A former car executive who now builds "loitering munitions".
*   **The Western Auditor:** Trying to verify supply chains but finding doors closed.

### Output Format
*   Compile a "Dossier" with:
    *   **Trigger:** A visit to a "dual-use" facility.
    *   **Setting:** The assembly line. Robots painting camouflage instead of metallic blue.
    *   **Conflict:** The realization that trade is no longer about prosperity, but about preparation for war.
