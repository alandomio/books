# Research Instructions: Chapter 6, Scene 3
## "Internet Balcanizzato (Splinternet)"

**Objective:** Depict the physical and logical fragmentation of the Internet. It's no longer the World Wide Web; it's the "West Web" vs. the "Red Web".

### 1. The Physical Layer (Cables & Satellites)
*   **Undersea Cables:** Investigate the "Cable War". US blocking Chinese cables (HMN Tech) and vice versa. The "Peace Cable" (China-Pakistan-Europe).
*   **Satellites:** Starlink (US) vs. Qianfan/Guowang (China). The battle for Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

### 2. The Logical Layer (Protocols & Standards)
*   **New IP:** China's proposal to the ITU for a "New IP" protocol that allows centralized control (killing anonymity).
*   **RuNet:** Russia's successful tests of disconnecting from the global internet.
*   **The Great Firewall:** How it has evolved into the "Great Cannon" (offensive capability).

### 3. The Setting
*   **Location:** A Network Operations Center (NOC) in a neutral location like **Singapore** or **Dubai**, where the two internets meet (and clash). Or perhaps a cable landing station. Let's go with a **Cable Landing Station in Djibouti** or **Marseille**. Djibouti is a key choke point.

### 4. Key Characters
*   **The Network Engineer:** A tired technician trying to route traffic between two incompatible worlds.
*   **The Cyber-Mercenary:** Someone who profits from the fragmentation (smuggling data).

### Output Format
*   Compile a "Dossier" with:
    *   **Trigger:** A "routing incident" where data from the West is blocked or hijacked by the East's new protocol.
    *   **Setting:** The humming server room of a landing station in Djibouti.
    *   **Conflict:** The death of the "Open Internet" dream.
