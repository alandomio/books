# Research Instructions: Chapter 6, Scene 2
## "Il Vertice dei BRICS+ (La Dedollarizzazione)"

**Objective:** Depict a high-stakes summit of the expanded BRICS (BRICS+) where the main agenda is the creation of an alternative financial system to bypass the US Dollar and SWIFT.

### 1. The "Unit" (The Common Currency)
*   **Concept:** Investigate the proposal for a BRICS currency (often called "The Unit" or backed by gold/commodities). Is it a physical currency or a digital accounting unit?
*   **Backing:** What is it backed by? (Gold, Oil, Rare Earths?).
*   **mBridge:** The role of "mBridge" (CBDC platform) in facilitating these transactions without the dollar.

### 2. The Expansion (BRICS+)
*   **New Members:** Who has joined by 2027? (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia are already in. Who else? Indonesia? Nigeria?).
*   **The Vibe:** It's not just an economic bloc; it's a political statement. "The Global Majority".

### 3. The Setting
*   **Location:** Kazan, Russia (site of the 2024 summit) or maybe Rio de Janeiro (Brazil G20/BRICS host). Let's go with **Dubai** or **Riyadh** to symbolize the shift of the petrodollar to the "petroyuan". Let's choose **Riyadh, Saudi Arabia**.
*   **Atmosphere:** Opulent, confident, futuristic. A stark contrast to the decaying WTO in Geneva.

### 4. Key Characters
*   **The Saudi Prince:** Hosting the event, playing both sides but leaning East.
*   **The Russian Technocrat:** The architect of the new payment system (Nabiullina archetype).
*   **The Chinese Overseer:** Quietly ensuring everything aligns with the RMB's internationalization.

### Output Format
*   Compile a "Dossier" with:
    *   **Trigger:** The official launch of the "BRICS Pay" system or the "Unit".
    *   **Setting:** A hyper-modern conference center in Riyadh.
    *   **Conflict:** The technical difficulty of replacing the dollar vs. the political will to do it.
