# Research Instructions: Chapter 6, Scene 5
## "La Nuova Mappa (L'Indottrinamento)"

**Objective:** Depict how the "Blocs" are rewriting history and geography to suit their narratives. It's not just about trade; it's about the mind.

### 1. The New Maps
*   **China:** The "10-dash line" (or more) map. Renaming of places in India/Russia.
*   **Russia:** New textbooks showing the "New Territories" (annexed Ukraine) as historically Russian.

### 2. Patriotic Education
*   **China:** "Xi Jinping Thought" in schools. The rejection of "Western values".
*   **Russia:** The "Fundamentals of Russian Statehood" course. Military training in schools.

### 3. The Setting
*   **Location:** A classroom. Maybe in **Moscow** or **Beijing**. Or a printing press where millions of new textbooks are being produced. Let's go with a **Printing Press in St. Petersburg** or **Beijing**. The smell of fresh ink and lies.

### 4. Key Characters
*   **The Editor:** A historian forced to rewrite chapters he wrote ten years ago.
*   **The Censor:** A bureaucrat ensuring the "correct" narrative.

### Output Format
*   Compile a "Dossier" with:
    *   **Trigger:** The approval of a new history textbook for the 2027 school year.
    *   **Setting:** The rhythmic noise of the printing press.
    *   **Conflict:** Truth vs. Loyalty. The erasure of the "Global Era".
