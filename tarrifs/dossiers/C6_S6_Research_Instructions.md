# Research Instructions: Chapter 6, Scene 6
## "La Nuova Cortina di Ferro (Il Mondo a Blocchi)"

**Objective:** Depict the final solidification of the world into two hostile blocs. The end of travel, the end of exchange, the end of the "Global Village".

### 1. The Physical Barriers
*   **The Finnish Border:** The fence with Russia. The closing of crossings.
*   **The DMZ 2.0:** The militarization of the border between Poland/Baltics and Belarus/Russia.

### 2. The Legal Barriers
*   **Visa Bans:** The difficulty for Russians/Chinese to visit the West and vice versa.
*   **"Foreign Agent" Laws:** The criminalization of contact with the "other side".

### 3. The Setting
*   **Location:** A border crossing. **Narva (Estonia/Russia)** or **Imatra (Finland/Russia)**. A bridge where two worlds stare at each other.
*   **Atmosphere:** Cold, snowy, silent. No trucks, no tourists. Only guards and drones.

### 4. Key Characters
*   **The Border Guard:** Watching a bridge that no one crosses anymore.
*   **The Exile:** Someone trying to wave to a relative on the other side.

### Output Format
*   Compile a "Dossier" with:
    *   **Trigger:** The final closure of the last checkpoint.
    *   **Setting:** The "Friendship Bridge" in Narva, now a fortress.
    *   **Conflict:** The realization that the door is locked, and the key has been thrown away.
