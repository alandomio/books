description: Convert Markdown to PDF
---

This workflow describes how to convert a Markdown file to PDF using the internal script.

1. Ensure you are in the project root: `/home/alan/dev/books/books/separazione_carriere`
2. Run the conversion script:
// turbo
```bash
./convert_md_to_pdf.sh <input_file>.md
```
3. The PDF will be generated in the same directory as the input file with the same name.
