# Research Instructions: Chapter 5, Scene 6
## "L'Ultimatum del Sud (L'OPEC dei Metalli)"

**Objective:** Investigate the potential formation of an "OPEC for Critical Minerals" (Lithium, Nickel, Cobalt), led by Indonesia and South American nations, to control prices and leverage geopolitical power against the West.

### 1. The Cartel Proposal
*   **Indonesia's Role:** Investigate Minister Luhut Pandjaitan's proposal for a Nickel cartel (similar to OPEC). What is the status?
*   **The Lithium Triangle:** Have Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina made concrete steps towards a Lithium cartel? (Mexico's involvement?).
*   **The Mechanism:** How would it work? Export quotas? Price floors? Ban on raw ore exports (already done by Indonesia)?

### 2. The Geopolitical Reaction
*   **Western Panic:** How are the US and EU reacting? (WTO complaints, "Critical Raw Materials Act").
*   **China's Position:** Would China support this? (They are the biggest buyer, so a cartel might hurt them, BUT they might use it to hurt the West if they control the cartel members).

### 3. The Setting (Hypothetical Summit)
*   **Location:** Jakarta (Indonesia) or La Paz (Bolivia).
*   **Atmosphere:** A secret or high-level summit. "The Revenge of the Global South".
*   **Key Figures:** Luhut Pandjaitan (Indonesia), Luis Arce (Bolivia), Gabriel Boric (Chile).

### Output Format
*   Compile a "Dossier" with:
    *   **Trigger:** A joint declaration or a secret agreement signed.
    *   **Setting:** A luxurious but fortified hotel in Jakarta.
    *   **Conflict:** The West realizes it has lost control of the pricing power. The "Free Market" is dead; the "Managed Market" is born.
