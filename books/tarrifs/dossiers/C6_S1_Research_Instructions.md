# Research Instructions: Chapter 6, Scene 1
## "Il Fantasma di Ginevra (La Morte del WTO)"

**Objective:** Depict the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva as a zombie institution—physically present but functionally dead. The "Appellate Body" has been paralyzed for years, and now, in 2027, the entire building is a monument to a bygone era of rules-based order.

### 1. The Paralysis of the Appellate Body
*   **Status:** Confirm that the US has continued to block the appointment of judges. Is there *any* judge left? (Likely zero).
*   **The "Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement" (MPIA):** Is it working? Or have major powers (US, India, etc.) ignored it?
*   **Recent Disputes:** Find a recent major dispute (e.g., China vs US on chips) where the WTO ruled, and the loser simply "appealed into the void" (blocking the ruling forever).

### 2. The Atmosphere in Geneva
*   **Location:** Centre William Rappard. Describe the architecture (neoclassical/rationalist). Is it empty? Are diplomats just drinking coffee and collecting per diems?
*   **Director General:** Who is the current DG? (Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala's term might be over or renewed). Is she frustrated?
*   **The "Security Exception" (Article XXI):** How are countries abusing this article to justify *any* tariff? (National Security = Carte Blanche).

### 3. Key Characters (Archetypes)
*   **The Old Guard:** A veteran trade lawyer who remembers the "glory days" of the 90s.
*   **The New Realist:** A young diplomat (maybe Indian or Brazilian) who knows the real decisions are made in Washington or Beijing, not here.

### Output Format
*   Compile a "Dossier" with:
    *   **Trigger:** A final, futile ruling on a major trade war issue that everyone ignores.
    *   **Setting:** The empty corridors of the WTO headquarters.
    *   **Conflict:** Law vs. Power. The realization that "Might makes Right" is the new global constitution.
